# Hello ! :space_invader::robot:
---
#### I'm a Game Programmer with experience in Unity and Unreal.
#### I have a Bachelor in Computer Science, i studied programming and cyber security during my time in the University.
---
I'm using this page to act as a portfolio of mine on game prototypes that i have made, to make this portfolio clear and concise i would only include some prototypes that i think is worth mentioning and explained. At the end of the page i would put in more statistics and background on how i got here and how game design became my passion.

Feel free to jump to any of the section i've made :   
>- [P01 - CTFDash](#p01-ctfdash)
>- [P02 - Enviroment Prototype](#p02-enviroment-prototype)
>- [P03 - Pathfinding Prototype](#p03-pathfinding-prototype)  
>- [About Me](#about-me)
     
> I'll also have the downloadable version of my prototypes below.
