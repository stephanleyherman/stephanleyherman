# Hello ! :space_invader::robot:

#### I'm a Game Programmer with experience in Unity and Unreal.
#### I have a Bachelor in Computer Science, i studied programming and cyber security during my time in the University.

I'm using this page to act as a portfolio of mine on game prototypes that i have made, to make this portfolio clear and concise i would only include some prototypes that i think is worth mentioning and explained. At the end of the page i would put in more statistics and background on how i got here and how game design became my passion.               
Each of the section will also have a General Outline part and the More Details part where i explain more on the game engine side of things and how i made certain things in the prototype.

Feel free to jump to any of the section i've made :

# {P01} CTFDash

## General Outline               
This is a Strategy&Time Management game where you solve competitive cyber security CTF questions within a given time limit. you control a character in a small map where you need to interact with key items to achieve your goal. Mainly finishing a laptop's question then submitting it to the submission post for points, every laptop that you failed with lose you hearts and if it reaches zero the game is over.

![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i2.png)             
The game that i made took heavy inspiration from DinerDash where instead of using Food and Tables as a main mechanics i use Laptops and Tables.

<!-- Show table, laptop and the conveyor belt-->

The conveyor belt will spawn Laptop which you need to put in the "Tables" to be able to operate and see the questions inside, for the purpose of this game i only made 4 categories(Cryptography, WebEx, OSINT, General Knowledge) but i also have put in the function to make custom questions and custom categories as well via a json savefile script.
               
<br>          
           
<!-- Select amount of questions -->
![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i4.png)
The idea is that this game would be used as a gamification concept that connect the more common game mechanics with answering difficult CTF competition questions where they would choose the amount of questions that they're comfortable with and slowly go up doing more and more questions, in a limited amount of time. I also added a Review stage option after the timer runs out, it just contains the Laptops that was wrong or was discarded by the player.

<!-- Tutorial -->
![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i5.png)
I made this game as a part of my thesis, it required me to have people test the game as a part of the user satisfaction section, so i made a tutorial to help them understand how to play the game it is also made with Bahasa language instead of English since most people that test it don't speak english proficiently.
                
## More Details

## 1. {P01} - The Foundation of the project
   
   <!-- -->
   I use a Singleton to manage the input and output of questions, the question itself is saved in a scriptable object that you can manually add in the json file or you can add it in game in the Customize page. I also made several other items to make the game more interesting such as different keys that you can use to interact with the laptop like opening, closing and grabbing the laptop. Almost everything is put inside a single Player Script, looking back this is bad practice from my part since Player.cs became so bloated it has about 2000+ lines of code for no reason at all, i've stop doing this in future projects and instead opted out to make separate script files for most things to reduce unnecessary coupling.
   
   
## 2. {P01} - Scriptable Object and Savefile System
   
   <!-- SO picture here -->
   ![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i6.png)           
   I made a scriptable object that contain two types of questions at that point in time, a fill in the blank type question and multiple choice. I also structured it this way just incase we wanted to add another question type i can just extend the SO and make it have more variables to adjust it.
   
## 3. {P01} - Interactable Laptop
 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i7.png"  alt="1" width = 360px height = 240px ></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i8.png" alt="2" width = 360px height = 240px></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i9.png" alt="2" width = 360px height = 240px></td>
   </tr> 
  
</table>
   
   <!-- !Table here-->
   I wanted to make picking up the laptop feels nice, so i added a few keybinds to let you interact with it differently i achieve this by using conditionals, as an example a closed laptop cannot be grabbed so you need to open/close it by pressing F, if you have a laptop on you then you can't pick up another one until you put it down by pressing G for picking up/putting down laptops, you cannot open into the question screen of the laptop if the laptop screen is closed. the idea was to use these keys so the player would be more engaged.
                  
   The act of grabbing a laptop is also just an illusion, i wanted to save memory by having less GameObject/Actor when the game is running so i Destroy() the laptop that was being picked up, save it's information in the Player and then Instantiate() a new one when im interacting with a table.

## 4. {P01} - End of the game Review Manager
 
   <!-- Endgame Screen -->
   ![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i10.png)              
   Also using the singleton that i implemented, whenever the game finishes either by the player running out of time or by finishing all the questions they selected, another scene would be put up as the endgame screen. Here they can put their names in the local leaderboard or choose to review the questions that they have missed or failed.
  <!-- Review Image-->
  ![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p01-i11.png)             
  This map is generated by a loop, the topside and the bottomside is generated independently while the length of the body is adjusted accordingly to the amount of questions that was missed/failed. Since this is just for review they can't pick up the laptop nor submit anything it's purely used just to study.

# {P02} Enviroment Prototype
![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p02-i1.png)          
     
                      
## General Outline            
So the whole idea that i had for this one was a apocalyptic scenario where years has passed and people is forced to live underground. The assets that i used was bought i didn't make them myself but i did stitch the whole thing up myself and made the lightning from scratch.

![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p02-i2.png)      
I wanted to test out my level design skill by making a map, where the player would tranverse an abandoned section of the underground, i put things where i thought it would make sense and tell a story of what went down and put the appropriate zombie with the right outfit there.

![alt text](https://github.com/stephanleyherman/imagedumprepo/blob/main/p02-i3.png)      
I also added some functionality to the project, i added movements, guns, and zombie AIs because maybe someday i wanna return to this and develop it some more because this is one of the most fun project i had made.
