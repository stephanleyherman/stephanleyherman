# Hello ! :space_invader::robot:
---
#### I'm a Game Programmer with experience in Unity and Unreal.
#### I have a Bachelor in Computer Science, i studied programming and cyber security during my time in the University.
---
I'm using this page to act as a portfolio of mine on game prototypes that i have made, to make this portfolio clear and concise i would only include some prototypes that i think is worth mentioning and explained. At the end of the page i would put in more statistics and background on how i got here and how game design became my passion.               
Each of the section will also have a General Outline part and the More Details part where i explain more on the game engine side of things and how i made certain things in the prototype.

Feel free to jump to any of the section i've made :   
>- [P01 - CTFDash](#p01-ctfdash)
>- [P02 - Enviroment Prototype](#p02-enviroment-prototype)
>- [P03 - Pathfinding Prototype](#p03-pathfinding-prototype)  
>- [About Me](#about-me)

> [!NOTE]
> The downloadable version of my prototypes is available below !

## General Outline               
This is a Strategy&Time Management game where you solve competitive cyber security CTF questions within a given time limit. you control a character in a small map where you need to interact with key items to achieve your goal.
<!-- Diner Dash Image Here -->
The whole idea of this game was to make something akin with DinerDash where instead of using Food and Tables as a main mechanics i use Laptops and Tables.
<!-- Show table, laptop and the conveyor belt-->
The conveyor belt will spawn Laptop which you need to put in the "Tables" to be able to operate and see the questions inside, for the purpose of this game i only made 4 categories(Cryptography, WebEx, OSINT, General Knowledge) but i also have put in the function to make custom questions and custom categories as well via a json savefile script.
